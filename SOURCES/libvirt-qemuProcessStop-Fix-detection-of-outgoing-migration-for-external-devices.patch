Subject: [PATCH] qemuProcessStop: Fix detection of outgoing migration for
 external devices
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

When cleaning up host in qemuProcessStop(), our external helper
processes (e.g. swtpm) want to know whether the domain is being
migrated out or not (so that they restore seclabels on a device
state that's on a shared storage).

This fact is reflected in the @outgoingMigration variable which
is set to true if asyncJob is anything but
VIR_ASYNC_JOB_MIGRATION_IN. Well, we have a specific job for
outgoing migration (VIR_ASYNC_JOB_MIGRATION_OUT) and thus we
should check for that.
